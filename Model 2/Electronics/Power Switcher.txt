==Battery Supply==
1) When adapter is not present, the adapter node would rail LOW b/c of the 500K pull-down resistor.
2) The Sig pin would rail HIGH to the battery voltage, the M5 PMOS would close, and the active supply 
    would be the battery.

==Adapter Supply==    
1) When the adapter is present, the adapter node would rail HIGH.
2) The Sig pin would then rail LOW, the M5 PMOS would open, and the active supply would no longer
    be the battery.
3) On the other hand, when the Sig pin rails LOW, the Adapter would become the active supply.
4) Also, the LM317 input would rail HIGH, the M7 NMOS would close, the M8 PMOS would
    close, and the LM317 output would be shorted to the battery.
